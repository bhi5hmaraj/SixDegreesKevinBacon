This was an assignment that I did quite some time ago (Nov 2015) for the course Introduction to science of Networks by [Sashi Prabh](https://sites.google.com/a/snu.edu.in/shashi-prabh/home) .

The idea was inspired from a similar assignment in [Princeton](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring03/cs226/assignments/bacon.html). The code for parsing and graph algrithms were written in Java . The IMDb data was also taken from their website.

The main idea is that many of the social networks have a property called [small world phenomenon](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/networks-book/networks-book-ch20.pdf) and the claim is that on an average any 2 person in the network can communicate to each other is 6. This idea was popularised by [Stanley Milgram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small-world_experiment).

The IMDb graph is a bipartite graph where the 2 sets of vertices are actors and movies. So any 2 actors who acted in the same movie are directly related to each other.
